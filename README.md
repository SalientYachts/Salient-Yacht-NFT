<h1 align="center">What we have to offer:</h1>

Our project is unique to the blockchain.
It bridges the digital world with the fiat world using physical assets to give crypto a solid use case and real intrinsic value!

Yacht manufacturing and production:<br />
We have made our yacht production lines available as NFTs. To order a yacht, one has to buy the build slot as an NFT.
This NFT can be sold at any stage during production until the yacht is delivered. This way the NFT production slots can be bought, initially, 
while the brand is established and sold to another buyer later when demand is higher.

We also have NFT Fractional ownership of the physical yachts. <br />
NFT holders earn rewards from yacht charters!<br />
So each NFT is asset backed!<br />

#Web3 Gaming:<br />
We have started development on our crypto and NFT based multiplayer Adventure Game for this hackathon. </br>
Players will be able to buy our NFT Fractional yachts and sail them (virtually in the game) to explore the ocean and various islands.
On each island are hidden NFT treasures and tokens, waiting to be found! 
Each island will be part of our virtual LAND SALE
(think Prince of Persia or Tomb Raider)

<h1 align="center"> We will have an ALL-IN-ONE dApp! </h1>

				• NFT Minting section for each asset				
				• Rewards section showing the balances and claimable amounts
				• NFT smart contract Market place - specially developed for our NFTs
				• Users can buy and sell yacht shares anytime!
				• DAO for our governance program for overall governance and a DAO for specific assets governance
        



Additional features:<br />

The reward system (WIND) is tied to the fractional NFTs and earned in the game.<br />
The fractional yachts are chartered in real life and the proceeds therefrom are used to buy back WIND tokens.
The value is stabilized from the buying pressure we put on the market and by the burning of these tokens.
The physical yachts are insured, meaning that effectively the initial value of the NFTs is insured as well.


<h1 align="center"> Global expansions plans for both the crypto and real world: </h1><br />
Marinas with factories and service depots for our yachts, including housing and moorings, 
as an all in one holiday resort, in multiple locations around the world!

We offer Partnership Advertising displayed on the yachts at International boat shows (see the example on the next page) 


VC & Support Partnerships:
Becoming one of our partners will give you (and your community, if applicable) these benefits:

Partners will be airdropped a special Salient Yachts Partnership NFT
This includes gated access to members only chat rooms
Private tours of our yachts at the yacht shows
Invitation and whitelisting to presales, NFT shares and events before the public

Most importantly we will brand the yacht and its sails with our partnerships logos
so when the yacht attends the international boat shows everyone will who we are and who helped us get there!
