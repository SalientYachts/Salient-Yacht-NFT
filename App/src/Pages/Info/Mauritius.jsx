                                The relocation to Mauritius far outweighs the global economic climate and tax rates! An export company in Mauritius pays only 3% corporate tax<br />

                                Become proud part-owner of the brand-new yacht.
                                We will base it in Mauritius where they have 1,34 million tourists per year.
                                As a Chartering yacht we will budget for USD 2 000 per day for the bareboat. The boat will be available 20 weeks of the year for paid charters and the balance for owners and cleaning/maintenance.<br />
                                <br />
                                The yacht will be registered in Mauritius and will be the asset of the company, providing excellent security.<br />

                                There might be a few job opportunities to run the chartering operation of the business.
